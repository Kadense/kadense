Our latest addition to the Kadense Framework is Malleable API's. These allow you to easily convert Malleable Models into API endpoints.

<!-- truncate -->

These API's are highly extensible, meaning that they can leverage any number of backend technologies. Starting off with a basic file system but more backends will be made available in due course.

[Full details of Malleable API's are available in the documentation](https://kadense.github.io/kadense/docs/The-Framework/Malleable-Apis/Basic-APIs)
