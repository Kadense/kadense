## Data Orchestration using KADENSE
Getting data to where it needs to be, in a cost effective manner is a challenge for any organisation, especially so when you're dealing with particularly sensitive data such as patient medical records. Indeed it's not just a case of getting the data to where it needs to be for the right audience, but on time as well. 

Sometimes the data you need is critical and needs to be updated in real-time, other data doesn't need to be 100% up to date, but needs to be updated in near-real-time so that it eventually consistent, and some data just needs to be updated periodically as part of batch processing. KADENSE provides solutions to all of these challenges using its data contracts engine.

KADENSE is capable of providing a gateway for trusted research environments using a hybrid containerised solutions and VDI estate.
